# Disabled Features - To Be Restored

## Overview
During Railway deployment fixes, several core features were temporarily disabled to resolve syntax errors and get the application running. These features need to be restored in a proper, production-ready way.

## Disabled Features

### 1. Advanced Transcription (UWC ASR + Deepgram)
**File:** `app/routes/mobile_routes/twilio.py`
**Status:** DISABLED
**Reason:** Removed async/await code that was causing syntax errors

**What was removed:**
- UWC ASR integration for transcription
- Deepgram fallback transcription
- Speaker diarization
- Advanced audio processing

**What remains:**
- Basic recording info storage
- Error handling for failed downloads
- Database updates for call records

**Restoration Plan:**
1. Move transcription to background Celery tasks
2. Implement proper async/await patterns
3. Add proper error handling and retries
4. Test with both UWC and Deepgram providers

### 2. S3 Audio Upload Integration
**File:** `app/routes/mobile_routes/twilio.py`
**Status:** DISABLED
**Reason:** Removed async S3 upload code

**What was removed:**
- Audio file upload to S3
- Temporary file handling
- S3 URL generation for UWC access

**Restoration Plan:**
1. Implement proper S3 service integration
2. Add file cleanup mechanisms
3. Handle large file uploads properly
4. Add progress tracking

### 3. UWC Client Integration
**Files:** Multiple route files
**Status:** PARTIALLY DISABLED
**Reason:** Some async patterns were causing issues

**What was affected:**
- UWC ASR transcription
- UWC RAG queries
- UWC training jobs
- UWC follow-up generation

**Restoration Plan:**
1. Review all UWC client usage
2. Implement proper async patterns
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Test all UWC integrations

## Priority Order for Restoration

### Phase 1: Critical Features
1. **Transcription Service** - Core functionality for call analysis
2. **S3 Integration** - Required for file storage
3. **UWC ASR** - Primary transcription provider

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. **UWC RAG** - Ask Otto functionality
2. **UWC Training** - Personal clones
3. **UWC Follow-ups** - AI-generated messages

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. **Background Processing** - Move heavy tasks to Celery
2. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive retry logic
3. **Monitoring** - Add proper logging and metrics

## Technical Notes

### Current State
- Application starts successfully
- Basic webhook handling works
- Database operations function
- No syntax errors

### What's Missing
- Advanced transcription capabilities
- S3 file storage integration
- UWC service integrations
- Background task processing

### Next Steps
1. Set up Celery workers for background tasks
2. Implement proper async patterns
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Test all integrations thoroughly

## Files to Review
- `app/routes/mobile_routes/twilio.py` - Recording callbacks
- `app/routes/rag.py` - RAG endpoints
- `app/routes/clones.py` - Training endpoints
- `app/routes/followups.py` - Follow-up generation
- `app/services/uwc_client.py` - UWC integration
- `app/core/s3.py` - S3 service

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Transcription works with UWC
- [ ] Transcription works with Deepgram fallback
- [ ] S3 uploads work properly
- [ ] UWC RAG queries work
- [ ] UWC training jobs work
- [ ] UWC follow-ups work
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Background tasks process correctly
